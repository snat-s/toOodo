# toOodo

I don't like that most kanban methods are REALLY slow.

I want to have an option where I can share my todos and make them public.

That's the reason for the app.

It originally was built for a school project in ~1 day.

To run this you should have a .env file and point to it:

```
node --env-file=.env server.js
```
